description: |
  A [Shape] is an [Object] that carries a voxel model made of [Block]s.

  It introduces an additional coordinate system called model space i.e. relative to model origin.
  Any point can be expressed in model space. If the point is expressed with integers, then it may represent a [Block] coordinates.

  Note that if the [Shape.Pivot](#property-pivot) is set to zero, then model space and local space become equivalent.

constructors: 
  - description: |
        Creates a [Shape] which model can be empty, loaded from an imported [Item] (see [Items]), or copied from an existing [Shape] or [MutableShape].

        The optional [table] parameter can be used to override default configuration: `{includeChildren = false, bakedLight = false}`.
        - `includeChildren` (false by default) will load all children of the original shape recursively.
        - `bakedLight` (false by default) determines whether or not the shape should be loaded with baked lighting.  If `true`, it will use the baked lighting information saved with the original item, or compute it from scratch if there was none. Any subsequent changes to the shape's blocks will automatically maintain its baked lighting.

        When copying a [Shape], `includeChildren` (false by default) determines if children should be copied as well.

          local myShape = Shape(Items.someuser.someitem)
          World:AddChild(myShape) -- adds created Shape to the World

properties:

    - name: "Palette"
      type: "array"
      description: |
          Palette is an [array] of [BlockProperties], with each entry corresponding to a style of block used by the [This]'s model. Each of the [This]'s block use a palette index, indicating which entry to use to draw that block.

          If [This].[Palette] is set, the shape will start using the new palette in place. Each of its block's palette index will then point to the [BlockProperties] of that new palette. This can be used to share a single palette between multiple shapes, for example to create effects by changing color on a whole group of shapes at once.
          Note that if you would like to keep the original colors of the shape while assigning another palette, you should use the [Palette](/reference/palette).[Merge](/reference/palette#functions-merge) function instead.

    - name: "Pivot"
      type: "Number3"
      description: |
          [This]'s pivot is a local point that acts as a reference for its transformations:
          - translation is applied from its parent's pivot to its own pivot
          - rotation is applied around the pivot

          It is set by default to [This]'s geometric center.

          You can override it with any point, even outside of the [This]'s bounding box, as a way to modify how transformations are applied.
          Note that setting the pivot to zero effectively means you are using the [This]'s model origin as reference point for transformations.
      samples:
        - code: |
            -- set it to any arbitrary point
            myShape.Pivot = { 2.3, 5.0, 1.5 }
            -- set it to a specific block, it will use block's center (*)
            myShape.Pivot = myShape:GetBlock(1, 1, 1)
            -- doing this resets pivot to its default value (*)
            myShape.Pivot = { myShape.Width * 0.5, myShape.Height * 0.5, myShape.Depth * 0.5 }
            -- (*) both these use-cases are valid only if myShape is not mutable or is mutable but has not been changed,
            -- otherwise, it is still possible: pivot must first be set to zero, then convert with myShape:BlockToLocal

    - name: "ComputeBakedLight"
      description: |
        Computes the shape baked lighting. It is a combination of a white ambient light and all blocks that were set as light sources. Other shapes entering inside this shape's bounding box will be affected by its baked lighting.
        
        This is an efficient way of applying lighting to shapes without affecting performance. The baked lighting of a shape is cached to speed up subsequent loads.
        
        Once a shape has baked lighting, it will be automatically maintained when changing its blocks.
        
        However, directly changing the transparency or light properties of shape's [Palette] entries of _existing_ blocks will not be reflected on the shape immediately, and will require another call to this function.
                
        You may want to call this function only if:
        - activating baked lighting on a shape for the first time
        - setting light property i.e. `shape.Palette[i].Light = true/false` of _existing_ shape blocks
        - setting transparency i.e. `shape.Palette[i].Color.A = newValue` of _existing_ shape blocks
        
        You _do not_ need to call this function if:
        - ANY blocks, including light and transparent blocks, are added/removed at runtime
        - setting light or transparent property of an unused palette entry first, before adding blocks using that entry

    - name: "ClearBakedLight"
      description: |
        Removes the shape baked lighting and frees up any memory used. It could be an optimization step for scenes pooling a large amount of shapes.

      arguments:

      samples:

    - name: "FitToScreen"
      description: |
          Fits the [This] to the given [Camera]'s view'. This function moves the shape back until it fits on the camera view.

          Optional parameters:
          - `screenRatio` indicates the percentage of the screen that should be covered by the target.
          - `spherize` switches between box fit (false) and sphere fit (true), spherize can be useful if the function is used every frame on a moving object, for smoother motion, but the fit will be wider.
