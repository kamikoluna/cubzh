type: "Fog"
description: |
    Fog is a shortcut to [Client].[Fog].
    
    Fog gives control over distance fog settings.

properties:
    - name: "On"
      type: "boolean"
      description: "Enables or disables Fog."
      samples:
        - code: Fog.On = true
        - code: Fog.On = false
        - code: | 
            -- toggles fog
            Fog.On = not Fog.On
    
    - name: "Distance"
      type: "number"
      description: |
          Sets [Fog].[Near](#property-near) while maintaining offset between [Fog].[Near](#property-near) & [Fog].[Far](#property-far)
      samples:
        - code: Fog.Distance = 100
    
    - name: "Near"
      type: "number"
      description: |
          Distance at which Fog starts, in world units. Default value is `200`.
          
          Anything closer than `Fog.Near` is not affected by the fog. Anything between `Fog.Near` and `Fog.Far` is progressively colored by fog.
      samples:
        - code: Fog.Near = 50
    
    - name: "Far"
      type: "number"
      description: |
          Distance at which Fog ends, in world units. Default value is `400`.

          Anything between `Fog.Near` and `Fog.Far` is progressively colored by fog, up to maximum fog opacity at `Fog.Far` and beyond.
      samples:
        - code: Fog.Far = 100
        - code: |
            -- both near and far can be set at once this way
            Fog.Near, Fog.Far = 50, 100
    
    - name: "Color"
      type: "Color"
      description: |
          Color of the fog, default is RGB `(0, 95, 139)`.

    - name: "LightAbsorption"
      type: "number"
      description: |
          Fog absorption factor regarding light blocks and light objects, default is `0.4`.

          0.0 ➡️ the color can 100% be seen through the fog.
          1.0 ➡️ the color is totally absorbed, like any other block.
      samples:
        - code: Fog.LightAbsorption = 0.1

    - name: "Layers"
      type: "table"
      description: |
          Integer or table of integers between 1 and 8. Cameras only render the fog if it corresponds to their layers.
